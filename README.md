# SortandPrintCourses

In the projects for this course, the problems I aimed to solve were efficient management and manipulation of bid and course data. This involved creating a program that could load data from CSV files, organize courses/bids using data structures such as vectors, binary search trees (BST), and hash tables, and allow users to interact with and retrieve information about the respective data. I leveraged data structures like vectors for flexibility, binary search trees for efficient search and sorting, and hash tables for quick access to course information. 

Recognizing the importance of data structures was crucial as they provided the foundation for organizing and retrieving information in an optimized manner. Understanding these structures allowed for more efficient and organized data handling, contributing to the overall effectiveness of the data program. Throughout the projects, I encountered challenges such as input validation and error handling, CSV parsing, integrating different data structures, and ensuring proper memory management. To overcome these roadblocks, I iteratively tested and debugged my code, seeking help from  online resources when needed.
